# This project is about a recipe maker
The main goal is to have a fully functional graphic user interface that will allow the user to:
- Add ingredient names
- Add ingredient quantities
- Add ingredient measurements
- Add steps to make the recipe
- Display those ingredient values and steps
- Remove ingredients
- Increase quantities of ingredients and much more

## New Features
The application has been updated, you can now:
- Add an unlimited number of recipes
- Add ingredient calorie data
- Associate ingredients to specific foodgroups
- Display ingredient calorie data
- Display foodgroup data
- Display a specific recipe
- Display all stored recipes
- Get warnings when your recipe exceeds 300 calories

All the previous features of the application can still be used with this new iteration of the app.

The user will be able to perform more functions as the project evolves.
The project is written in C# and is currently limited to the command line.
For a deeper dive into the functionality of the project, have a look at the code.

## Lecturer Feedback
My part 1 previously did not clear the recipe properly. For part 2, I changed my clear method to clear the list using the built in function of the generic List<T> collection called the .clear() method.
  This method will clear all the elements stored in the List everytime the method is called/invoked.
